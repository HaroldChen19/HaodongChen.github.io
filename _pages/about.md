I'm a year-3 undergraduate student from [School of Automation](https://zdhxy.nwpu.edu.cn/), [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/). And I'm also a research intern of [CityMind Lab](https://citymind.top/) in [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/). 

As an EE major student, I have more than a passing interest in artificial intelligence. So my research interests include **Computer Vision, Multi-Modal, and Large Language Model(LLM)**.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Dian Shao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=amxDSLoAAAAJ&hl=en) of SSLab from NPU, and [Prof. Yuxuan Liang](http://yuxuanliang.com/) of CityMind Lab from HKUST(GZ).




Work Experience
------
- **Research Intern** in SSLab, NPU 7/2023-Present<br>
I began my internship in 7/2023. Supervised by Prof.Shao primarily conducting research related to **Computer Vision** and **LLM**.
- **Research Intern** in CityMind Lab, HKUST(GZ) 4/2023-Present<br>
I began my internship remotely in 4/2023 and on-site from 7/2023-8/2023. Supervised by Prof.Liang primarily conducting research related to **Multi-Modal** and **Computer Vision**.




Research Experience
------
- **Fine-Grained Action Recognition**    9/2023-Present<br>
Central to our pursuit is the conception and realization of an elevated multi-modal fine-grained action recognition framework, characterized by a uniform video format serving as the network's input substrate. This research endeavors to **culminate in the crystallization of a suite of meticulous fine-grained action recognition protocols**, poised to propel the advancement of domains such as sports commentary and surveillance parsing, supervised by **Prof. Shao**.
- **Parent-Child Dialogue Language Model**           7/2023-Present<br>
Grounded in the inherent foundational paradigm shift characteristic of LLM, this research is predicated upon a novel paradigm of human-computer interaction. Its ultimate objective revolves around the nuanced cultivation of familial harmony to **establish an advanced and harmonious framework capable of reconfiguring the familial landscape**, supervised by **Prof. Shao**.
- **Contrastive Urban Region Profiling**             7/2023-10/2023<br>
Our work has been sent to the [WWW2024](https://www2024.thewebconf.org/) conference for review!
Drawing inspiration from contrastive learning principles, this research endeavors to **enhance the efficacy of urban governance initiatives** by seamlessly integrating diverse multimodal data sources. The primary objective is to maximize the extraction of comprehensive urban profiling insights from satellite imagery and remote sensing maps, supervised by **Prof. Liang**.
