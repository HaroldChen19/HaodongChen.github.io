I'm a year-3 undergraduate student from [School of Automation](https://zdhxy.nwpu.edu.cn/), [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/). 

As an EE major student, I have more than a passing interest in artificial intelligence. My research interests include **Computer Vision, Multi-Modal, and Large Language Model**.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Dian Shao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=amxDSLoAAAAJ&hl=en) of DianLab from NPU. And I was advised by [Prof. Yuxuan Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n9cODgcAAAAJ) of [CityMind Lab](https://citymind.top/) from [HKUST(GZ)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/).

I will be applying for my 25FALL PhD, so wish me good luck~

Research Experience
------
- **Fine-Grained Action Recognition**    9/2023-Present<br>
Central to our pursuit is the conception and realization of an elevated multi-modal fine-grained action recognition framework, characterized by a uniform video format serving as the network's input substrate. This research endeavors to **culminate in the crystallization of a suite of meticulous fine-grained action recognition protocols**, poised to propel the advancement of domains such as sports commentary and surveillance parsing, supervised by Prof. Shao.
- **Contrastive Urban Region Profiling**             7/2023-10/2023<br>
Drawing inspiration from contrastive learning principles, this research endeavors to **enhance the efficacy of urban governance initiatives** by seamlessly integrating diverse multimodal data sources. The primary objective is to maximize the extraction of comprehensive urban profiling insights from satellite imagery and remote sensing maps, supervised by Prof. Liang.
- **Parent-Child Dialogue Language Model**           7/2023-8/2023<br>
Grounded in the inherent foundational paradigm shift characteristic of LLM, this research is predicated upon a novel paradigm of human-computer interaction. Its ultimate objective revolves around the nuanced cultivation of familial harmony to **establish an advanced and harmonious framework capable of reconfiguring the familial landscape**, supervised by Prof. Shao.
