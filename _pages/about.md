I'm a year-3 undergraduate student from [School of Automation](https://zdhxy.nwpu.edu.cn/), [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/). 

As an EE major student, I have more than a passing interest in artificial intelligence. My research interests include **Computer Vision, Multi-Modal, and Large Language Model**.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Dian Shao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=amxDSLoAAAAJ&hl=en) of DianLab from NPU. And I was advised by [Prof. Yuxuan Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n9cODgcAAAAJ) of [CityMind Lab](https://citymind.top/) from [HKUST(GZ)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/).

I will be applying for my 25FALL PhD, so wish me good luck~




Work Experience
------
- **Research Intern** in DianLab, NPU 7/2023-Present<br>
I began my internship in 7/2023. Supervised by Prof.Shao primarily conducting research related to **Computer Vision** and **LLM**.
- **Research Intern** in CityMind Lab, HKUST(GZ) 4/2023-10/2023<br>
I began my internship remotely in 4/2023 and on-site during 7/2023-8/2023. Supervised by Prof.Liang primarily conducting research related to **Multi-Modal** and **Spatial-temporal Data Mining**.

Research Experience
------
- **Fine-Grained Action Recognition**    9/2023-11/2023<br>
Our work has been submitted for review to CVPR2024!<br>
  -The first semi‑supervised fine‑grained action recognition framework based on transformer;<br>
  -Proposed multi-granularity random sampling with a simple but effective temporal data augmentation method to better learn inter-frame fine-grained action information;<br>
  -Designed a threshold adaptive approach to effectively mitigate the problem of uneven confidence in video data and time consumption during debugging.<br>
- **Contrastive Urban Region Profiling**             7/2023-10/2023<br>
  -The first‑ever framework that integrates the knowledge of text modality into urban region profiling;<br>
  -Blending text knowledge into visual representations through deep modality interaction, utilizing contrastive and language modeling losses;<br>
  -Developed a novel web‑based application enabled by the proposed model to offer insights about urban planning.<br>
- **Parent-Child Dialogue Language Model**           7/2023-9/2023<br>
  -Leveraging the paradigm shift of Large Language Models for a new form of human‑computer interaction;<br>
  -Aiming to enhance familial harmony by establishing an advanced framework for reshaping the family landscape.<br>
